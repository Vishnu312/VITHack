# Description
The aim of our project 'Know Covid19' is to provide one stop solution to know everything about Covid19 in India in a single website. Despite this being a major public healthcare crisis most people are still unaware of how to contact 1st responders or find medical information about the virus. Our website will help the common man to not only understand the facts about this virus but also provide him with critical information like the number of beds in hospitals and medical colleges in every state but also the contact information of the first responders. This website has multiple section.

# 1.Contact & Helpline Information:
We used the given API to extract the information to provide the contact details of the first responders in each region. This will help the common man quickly inform the authorities which is a critical step in the Test-Track-Trace process.

# 2.Notifications & advisories:
We have used the given API to provide the information about the latest notifications and regulations released day to day by the central government. This will help everyone to keep track of the present situation of the lockdown and unlock being followed in the country and be informed about the latest developments about the virus

# 3.Hospitals Dashboards:
We have used the given API to provide the number of vacant beds in the hospitals and medical colleges in each and every state. This will ensure the patients know exactly which hospitals have free beds which will save lives and time.

# 4.Plot a graph for the Deceased person
With the given dataset we have created our own API and we have extracted the data of the deceased, hospitalized and recovered patients to display it in a graph with the filters like gender, state and age. This will help users track and understand the ongoing pandemic

# 5.Donations:
Since this public health crisis has become an economic crisis which has hit the poorest of the poor hardest. So we should users a chance to give back the community.

# 6.Chatbot:
We have also included a Chatbot like feature which will help users conduct a self assessment of themselves. If they are found to have any Covi19 symptoms they are automatically redirected to the helpline page.

# 7.Covid19 ML model:
We have also attempted to create a model that predicts whether the user is infected based on the parameters like fever, presence of dry cough, etc. We have managed to host this on a local host.

# Future scope:
The ML model can be deployed in the cloud and integrated with the rest of the website.
